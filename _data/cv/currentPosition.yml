    <u>Objectives</u>
    - Extend the optical model to fluorescence, to predict spectral reflectances, and also the lateral propagation of light around the illuminated area (PSF), taking care to keep analytical or semi-analytical models easy to reverse.
    - Reduce as much as possible the number of parameters to be evaluated in these models for a given tissue, taking care to keep the information useful for the clinical analysis of the tissues (tests on phantoms or clinical data already acquired)
    - Find a measurement strategy (multi-position, multi-angle, multi-excitation?) to evaluate these parameters (model used in inverse approach), ensuring that the measurement system can be used by a practitioner in clinical routine.
    - Implement the instrumentation and methodology for skin characterization (healthy skin, pathologies), glioma resection (PpIX quantification), or organ transplantation.
