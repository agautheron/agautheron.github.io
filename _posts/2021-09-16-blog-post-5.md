In this blog post I will explain how to set up a fully synchronized Zotero library between  several machine.  There are a lot of tutorial that explain how to doo that, but I believe that they do not cover the full topic, as they do not explain how to synchronize parameters between machines. Thus it can be painful having to redo all your setting every time you set up a new machine. 

**Caution**: This tutorial is meant for unix users. You will need root privilege.

## Setting remote library and setting folders

To synchronize our library and zotero's parameters between several computers we will need a cloud instance. For my installation I used the open source project [/e/ os](https://e.foundation/e-email-invite/), you can create a free account with 1GB of storage included. I believe this tutorial can be adapted to dropbox or google drive solutions. The main point here is to access your cloud storage directly from your local file arborescence. 

In your cloud documents create the following folder tree

```bash
.
└── zotero/
    ├── library/
    └── profile/
        └── tmp/
```

We need the tmp/ folder because of a bug of Zotero, we will delete it later. 

## Installing Zotero 

I describe how to install Zotero from scratch. If you already have a Zotero library, better is to backup that library and to remove all trace of Zotero from your system, e.g. 

```bash
sudo rm -r /opt/zotero 
rm -r ~/Zotero
rm -r ~/.zotero
```

Go to [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) and download the latest version of Zotero: for me it is *Zotero-5.0.96.3_linux-x86_64*.tar.bz2 In the terminal go to your downloads folder and uncompress it: 

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xf Zotero-5.0.96.3_linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 
```

Those command extract the files in a new folder:  *~/Dowloads/Zotero_linux-x86_64/*. Execute the following command in your terminal to move zotero in its installation folder. 

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/zotero 
sudo mv ~/Dowloads/Zotero_linux-x86_64/* /opt/zotero 
rm -r ~/Dowloads/Zotero_linux-x86_64/
```

**Warning**: please do not start Zotero until I say so.  

## Creating a desktop file

We now create a desktop file in order for zotero to appear in the list of your app. 

```bash
sudo /opt/zotero/set_launcher_icon
ln -s /opt/zotero/zotero.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/zotero.desktop
```

Zotero should then appear either in your launcher or in the applications list when click the grid icon (“Show Applications”), from which you can drag it to the launcher.

## Linking Zotero to shared parameters

To do so we will set the profile to our shared location. execute the following command from your terminal. 

```bash
./opt/zotero/zotero --ProfileManager
```

Zotero profile manager window will open up.

| ![Step 5](https://tschmoderer.github.io/images/blogs/2021_09_zotero/zotero_profile_4.png)**Rename the profile** | **After clicking on *Finish* you will be send back to the first window. There, click on *Start Zotero*** |

Congratulation you just set a shared parameter folder for your different zotero instances.
