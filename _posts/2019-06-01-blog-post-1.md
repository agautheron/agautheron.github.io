During summer 2019, I was invited in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of the University of Cambridge. I worked with [Noemie Debroux](https://sites.google.com/view/noemiedebroux/) and [Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero](https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/) on MRI reconstruction.

# The Project

Due to technical difficulties, MRI data are incomplete, thus to recover the image of the patient, we have to develop technique to extrapolate from this set of incomplete data. Variational methods tends to minimize the following energy 

## Direct methods

$$
E(\mathbf{m}) = \int_0^T \frac{1}{2}\|K\mathbf{m}-f\|_2^2 + \lambda_1\|\nabla \mathbf{m}\|_1+\lambda_2\|\Psi\mathbf{m}\|_1\ dt
$$

Where we have

* $\mathbf{m}$ : The MRI sequences we want to reconstruct,
* $K$ : The undersampling Fourier operator,
* $f$ : The data we possess,
* $\Psi$ : A Wavelet operator,

Hence this energy try to minimize the fidelity of the reconstruction with a constraint on the TV norm of each images and the sparsity of the images in the wavelet domain. 

## Our contribution
The main idea of the project was to combine 

# Tourism
During this two month, I enjoyed walking in the old street of Cambridge. It was impressive to be in the city where DNA was discover,
