During summer 2019, I was invited in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of the University of Cambridge. I worked with [Noemie Debroux](https://sites.google.com/view/noemiedebroux/) and [Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero](https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/) on MRI reconstruction.

# The Project

Due to technical difficulties, MRI data are incomplete, thus to recover the image of the patient, we have to develop technique to extrapolate from this set of incomplete data. Variational methods tends to minimize the following energy 

$$
E(\mathbf{m}) = \int_0^T \frac{1}{2}\|K\mathbf{m}-f\|_2^2 + \lambda_1\|\nabla \mathbf{m}\|_1+\lambda_2\|\Psi\|_1\ dt
$$

The main idea of the project was to combine
