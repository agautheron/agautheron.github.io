Welcome on my professional web page. I am currently a Ph.D. student in nonlinear control theory under the supervision of [Witold Respondek](http://lmi.insa-rouen.fr/membres/9-membres/professeurs/19-respondek-witold.html) from [LMI](http://lmi.insa-rouen.fr/) (Rouen) and [Emmanuel Trélat](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/trelat/) from [LJLL](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/) (Paris). <br/>

# Research interests
My PhD research are of two kind. First I want to deeply understand nonlinear dynamical control systems. Using the language of differential geometry my purpose is to classified quadratic nonlinear control systems. During his PhD [Witold Respondek](http://lmi.insa-rouen.fr/membres/9-membres/professeurs/19-respondek-witold.html) classified non linear dynamical system that are equivalent (up to a state diffeomorphism or up to feedback action) to a controllable linear system. We want to extand this results and found conditions for a system to be equivalent to a system with a prodcut of control. <br/>

On the other hand, I want to propose an improved version of the continuation method, developped first by [Yacine Chitour](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/perso/yacine.chitour). This method was developped to compute optimal control. However the method assume that we can avoid the singular set of the system. This is a practical strong assumptions. With  [Emmanuel Trélat](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/trelat/) we propose a modified algorithm giving an approximation of the optimal control but dealing with the singular set of the system. <br/>
