This module aims to provide students with the theoretical basis of signal processing (discrete/continuous signals, fourier transform, sampling, convolution, correlation). 

### Structure
The module is structured on lectures, as well as on theoretical and practical work. <br/>
The practical work covers the basics of digital signal processing (signal modeling, sampling, quantization, Fourier transform calculation, convolution, correlation) and the use of Matlab/Octave to carry out the practical work. 

During the three years of teaching, I was in charge of setting up evaluation exams and correcting papers in this subject.

### Practical Session:

 >Content:
 * First Session : 
     - Discovery of the Octave/MATLAB software,
	 - First applications of signal processing.
 * Second Session : 
     - Generate a signal with given characteristics in Octave/MATAB,
     - Study convolution and correlation using the two Octave programs provided.
 * Third Session : 
     - Study the influence of the different parameters involved in the generation of a signal as well as the frequency representation of signals.
