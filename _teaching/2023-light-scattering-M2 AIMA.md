The objective of this master course is to present and explain the physical mechanisms of light scattering, as well as modeling methods to predict the propagation of light in scattering media in the radiative transfer approximation.

# Structure 
The course begins with an introduction describing the various fields of application of light scattering: astronomy, medical imaging, computer graphics, appearance of materials.<br/>
The formalism of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) is then described in a first part: notion of collision coefficient, phase function, establishment of the RTE, diffuse or specular illumination and method of resolution by the discrete coordinate method. Some exercises illustrate this part of the course.<br/>
The formalism of the diffusion equation is then described in a second part, establishment of the diffusion equation in the isotropic case, method of resolution (in the framework of exercises) in the 1D (layer) and 2D cases (dipole method, Fourier transform method).

The course is structured as follows:
- 7 Lectures of three hours each
- 1 Practical Session of three hours
