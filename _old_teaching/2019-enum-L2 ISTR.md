The objective of the digital electronics module for audioprosthesists is to provide them with a base of knowledge in electronics. 
It follows an analog electronics module where the theoretical bases (voltage, current, etc..) and practices (handling of instruments) are taught. 

### Aim of Practical work
The practical work in electronics has two objectives:
- to (re)get to know the instruments and the basic equipment (mini wiring board, passive components, active component, stabilized power supply, multimeter, low frequency function generator, oscilloscope), 
- to realize the wiring of various circuits of digital electronics (digital-analog converter, counter/display, RS asynchronous and D Master-Slave flip-flops). 


In this subject, I ensured the implementation of evaluation exams and the correction of the copies during the two years I taught it.

### Practical Sessions:
* [First Session](https://agautheron.github.io/files/teaching/2019_ENum_ISTR/TP_initiation.pdf): handling of the instruments and material involved in the following sessions,
* Next sessions : completion of the following three topics in any order,
    * [RS/D flip-flops](https://agautheron.github.io/files/teaching/2019_ENum_ISTR/TP_bascules.pdf)
    * [Counter/Display](https://agautheron.github.io/files/teaching/2019_ENum_ISTR/TP_compteur_afficheur.pdf)
    * [Digital-to-Analog Converter](https://agautheron.github.io/files/teaching/2019_ENum_ISTR/TP_CNA.pdf)
