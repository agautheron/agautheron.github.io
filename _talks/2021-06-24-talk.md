#### Journée Normandie Mathématiques 2021

I presented some of the results of my thesis during one of the three parallel sessions in the afternoon. Here, you can retrieve the [abstract](https://tschmoderer.github.io/files/talks/20210624_13_fnm/abstract.pdf) and the [slides](https://tschmoderer.github.io/files/talks/20210624_13_fnm/presentation_240621.pdf) of my presentation.

A video caption of this talk was taken (see video bellow), recording started a few minutes after I started to talk so there misses the first slides.
