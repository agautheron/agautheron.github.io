#### Journée Normandie Mathématiques 2020

I presented the result of my thesis during one of the three parallel session in the afternoon. You can see the full details about this day [here](http://normandie.math.cnrs.fr/Journees/Journee12/index.html).

The talk I gave is a introduction to my phd thesis topic. I introduce the notion of *quadratic sub-manifolds* and gave some results about equivalence and classification of such sub-manifolds.
